Here, the program library for Mag3d v6.0.1 will be used to:

    - create a susceptibility model on a tensor mesh
    - forward model TMI data for a given survey and model
    - construct the sensitivity matrix and weights that will be used in the inversion
    - invert the magnetic data to recover a susceptibility model
    - demonstrate how to perform a least-squares as well as a sparse norm inversion
